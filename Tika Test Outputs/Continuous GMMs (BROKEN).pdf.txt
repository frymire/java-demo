Abstract. When the projection of a collection of samples onto a subset of basis feature
vectors has a Gaussian distribution, those samples have a generalized projective
Gaussian distribution (GPGD). GPGDs arise in a variety of medical images as well as
some speech recognition problems.  We will demonstrate that GPGDs are better
represented by continuous Gaussian mixture models (CGMMs) than finite Gaussian
mixture models (FGMMs).

This paper introduces a novel technique for the automated specification of
CGMMs, height ridges of goodness-of-fit.  For GPGDs, Monte Carlo simulations and
ROC analysis demonstrate that classifiers utilizing CGMMs defined via goodness-of-fit
height ridges provide consistent labelings and compared to FGMMs provide better true-
positive rates (TPRs) at low false-positive rates (FPRs).  The CGMM-based
classification of gray and white matter in an inhomogeneous magnetic resonance (MR)
image of the brain is demonstrated.

1 Introduction

The crux of statistical pattern recognition and data analysis is the accurate modeling of the
distributions of data.  This paper presents a novel technique which is ideally suited for
representing GPGDs.  GPGDs arise in a variety of medical images such as MR images
containing intensity inhomogeneities, X-ray CT images due to beam hardening, and SPECT
images due to deficiencies in attenuation compensation.  GPGDs also exist in some speech
and handwriting recognition problems.

It has been demonstrated that within small regions of an MR image, a tissue’s intensity
will be Gaussian distributed, yet the parameters of those localized Gaussian distributions
will vary as a result of an intensity inhomogeneity.  Consider the proton density (PD) MR
image in Fig. 1.  It was acquired and converted to byte pixel values as described in [2].  It
contains an intensity inhomogeneity which exists as a large scale dimming in the inferior
cerebellum.  The inhomogeneity can be quantified (Fig. 2) by Gaussian blurring the image
at a scale of 15 pixels using only those pixel’s having values between 100 and 200.  More
exact methods for measuring the inhomogeneity exist [4, 10, 16], but the stated approach
is sufficient for our demonstration.  The correlation between PD value and inhomogeneity

magnitude is revealed by a scatterplot (Fig. 3) formed from 984 hand-labeled white matter
and 788 gray matter samples from these images.  In that scatterplot, every local collection
of a tissue’s samples has a Gaussian distribution, but a continuum of Gaussians is needed to
represent each tissue’s entire distribution; the distributions are GPGDs.

In speech recognition, it is commonly accepted that hidden Markov models using
Gaussian distributions can represent certain aspects of the speech of a single person in a
controlled situation, e.g., given a fixed level of stress.  Smooth warpings can be applied to
the parameters of those Gaussians to transition them to new situations and speakers [3] .  To
account for such variations in speaker and situation, multiple Gaussians are needed; the
distributions resemble GPGDs.

When the correlations creating the GPGDs are well understood and easily measured, the
most accurate models can be obtained by directly eliminating their effects and then using
simple Gaussians [4, 10, 16]

.
  When the correlations are not well understood or easily

measured, Gaussian mixture models are appropriate.
Traditionally, FGMMs defined via maximum likelihood expectation maximization

(MLEM) have been used to represent GPGDs.  We will show that these distributions are
more accurately and consistently represented by continua of means and variances.  We call
such continua "traces."  We will show that the traces of a sampled GPGD can be extracted
via height ridges of goodness-of-fit functions, and that these traces accurately and
consistently define a CGMM of the underlying GPGD.

For this paper, the accuracy and consistency of the distribution models are quantified by
the accuracy and consistency of the classifiers they define.  That is, when a model ? of a
class i is used to provide class conditional probability estimates P(    x    | ?(i)) to a classifier,
the accuracy and consistency of the labelings produced by that classifier determine the
accuracy and consistency of the model.  Assuming equal class priors P(?(i)) and maximum
likelihood Bayes Rule classification, then

A classifier’s labeling accuracy is quantified by its TPRs and FPRs, and its labeling
consistency is the standard error of those rates.

Section 2 introduces finite and continuous Gaussian mixture modeling.  Section 3
presents our implementation of goodness-of-fit functions.  These functions respond
maximally when their parameters µ´ and ?´ match those of the distribution from which the
samples being tested originated.  That section also discusses the how these functions are
applied normal to the trace of a GPGD in order to extract that trace using a height ridge

definition, and it ties the traces to the definition of a CGMM.  Section 4 uses GPGDs,
Monte Carlo simulations, and ROC analysis to compare FGMMs with CGMMs.  Section 5
demonstrates the CGMM-based classification of tissues in an inhomogeneous MR image.

2  Gaussian Mixture Modeling

A mixture model is formed using multiple “component” distributions.  In a Gaussian
mixture model the component distributions are multivariate (N-dimensional) normal
densities each of which is parameterized by ?.

Most investigations involving mixture models use FGMMs trained via MLEM.  While no
FGMM training algorithm is best in all situations, MLEM is easy to implement and
provides several desirable convergence properties such as monotonic convergence [5, 7, 8 ,
18].  MLEM, however, is an approximate gradient ascent algorithm, and it is subject to
non-optimal local and global maxima.  While MLEM is relatively robust to these non-
optimal maxima [7, 15, 18], it will be shown that the FGMM component parameterizations
produced via MLEM can vary greatly and be far from optimal given different sets of samples
from the same distribution; FGMMs offer poor consistency.  This inconsistency i s
aggravated by the reliance on the user to specify the number of components.

While much research has focused on automatically determining an appropriate number
of components for a given problem, a generally applicable approach has not be found [9,
18].  A FGMM’s expected accuracy does not vary monotonically as a function of the
number of components.  Additionally, MLEM’s non-optimal maxima can lead to poorly
utilized components; the effective number of components in an FGMM may be less than
the user specified number of components.  GPGDs are comprised of an infinite number of
components, so determining an appropriate finite number of components to approximate
them with can be especially difficult.

2.2  Continuous Gaussian Mixture Modeling

A continuous mixture model consists of an uncountably infinite number of components
whose parameters ? span Nt traces T(j) through the parameter space of its components,
i.e., the domain of ?.  A CGMM provides a probability via

This equation follows the simplifying assumptions made by Dempster, Laird, and Rubin [5]
and states that since the underlying distribution is assumed to be a mixture, each sample i s
in fact generated by just one of the infinite number of components, the generating
component is determined via maximum likelihood, and the generating component provides

the best estimate of the sample’s probability.  The function F(    x    ;?) can be interpreted as
providing a trace point conditional sample probability, and ? as providing a trace point a
priori probability.  Equation 3 can therefore be rewritten as

The focus of this paper is the definition of the traces T(j) via height ridges of goodness-
of-fit functions.  A CGMM defined in this manner can accurately and consistently model the
continua of means and variances which form a GPGD.  For this paper, analysis is limited to
GPGD’s having one-dimensional traces.

3 Traces of Goodness-of-Fit

Each trace of a GPGD can be viewed as a continuum of central means (centers) with
smoothly changing variances normal to that continuum (widths).  A method has already
been developed for representing the centers and widths of objects.  That object
representation method is known as the medialness core [12].  Medialness cores have been
proven to be invariant to rotation, translation, intensity, and scale [12] and insensitive to
a wide variety of image and boundary noise [11].  To apply medialness core methods to the
representation of distributions, goodness-of-fit functions are used instead of medialness
functions because goodness-of-fit functions are sensitive to sample density whereas
medialness functions are sensitive to boundariness.

3.1. Univariate Gaussian Goodness-of-Fit

One class of goodness-of-fit functions is the univariate chi-squared measures.  This class
includes Pearson’s statistic ?P2 , Read and Cressie’s power divergent statistic ?R C&2 , and
the log likelihood ratio ?LLR2  [14].  Since our goal is to develop mixture models using
Gaussian components, the binned expected distribution     E     of these omnibus measures i s
derived from a univariate Gaussian.  These functions are therefore referred to as Gaussian
goodness-of-fit (GGoF) functions.

The parameters of these functions are µ´ and ?´, the mean and standard deviation to be
tested; µ´ and ?´ define the expected distribution     E    .  This paper uses six bins B=6 centered at
µ´ and clipped so as to capture samples within ±1.645?´ of µ´.  The GGoF functions are
devised so as to be maximal when their parameters µ´ and ?´ best match the µ and ? of the
population from which the samples originated.  This is achieved by subtracting the
standard goodness-of-fit functions from ? ?6 12 0 99 15 09? =( ) =. .  and then normalizing by
that value (Equation 6).  As a result of these modifications, a GGoF function’s value i s
expected to be greater than zero for 99% of the sets of samples which originate from a
Gaussian parameterized by µ´ and ?´.

The accuracy and consistency of the local maxima of the ?P2 , ?R C&2 , and ?LLR2  GGoF
functions were evaluated using 96 Monte Carlo simulations.  Each simulation consisted of
5000 runs.  The simulations considered four different training set sizes (20, 40, 80, 160
samples) from two distributions (a Gaussian with   µ  =128 and ?=16 and a log-normal
distribution using a log base of 1.6) and four different binning techniques (equirange,
equiprobable, overlapped-equirange, overlapped-equiprobable) [1].  For each Monte Carlo
run, the local maximum of the GGoF function was found via gradient ascent through (µ´,
?´).  The starting points for gradient ascent were selected from a 2D Gaussian distribution

centered at each population’s ideal parameter values (µ, ?) having a standard deviation of
5% of those values.  The accuracy of a local GGoF maximum was defined as the difference
between the GGoF parameters (µ´, ?´) of that maximum and the population’s actual
parameters (µ, ?).  Consistency was calculated as the standard error associated with each
parameter µ´ and ?´ of the maxima from each simulation.

Conclusions drawn include that 1) the binning method has more influence on accuracy
and consistency than the GGoF function; 2) the accuracy and consistency of the estimates
of µ do not vary significantly as a function of the number of samples, the GGoF function,
or the binning technique; 3) ?LLR2  with overlapped-equiprobable binning provides the
most accurate and consistent estimates ?.  As a result, ?LLR2  with overlapped-equirange
binning was used for all GGoF trace calculations.

3 . 2 Multivariate GGoF via Trace Tangents and Normals

To calculate multivariate GGoF values, the multivariate data about a given  µ ´ are converted
to multiple univariate distributions via projection onto a set of basis directions.  The
expected variance associated with each of those projections may differ.  The multivariate
GGoF value is the average ?LLR2  value from each of those projections.  We hypothesize
that neighboring GGoF trace points capture a distribution’s variance in the trace tangent
direction, so each trace point needs only to capture variance normal to the trace.

To estimate a trace’s normal (and tangent) directions as well as the expected variance of
the distribution in each of those directions, our algorithm extends the geometric measures
via statistics work conducted by Yoo [17].  Specifically, we suggest that eigenvectors of
the local data’s covariance matrix      ?     (L) well approximate the normal (and tangent)
directions of the GGoF trace, and the eigenvalues define expected variance ratios for each of
the normal directions.  Since      ?     (L) is a function of only two variables, i.e., a mean   µ  ´ and a
neighborhood size s´, its use in calculating multivariate GGoF functions allows those
functions to be parameterized by just   µ  ´ and s´.       ?     (L) approximation of the tangent allows a
GGoF trace to be traversed without derivative calculations.

     ?     (L) is measured using a Gaussian weighting G(•) of the samples S about   µ  ´ so as to
change smoothly given small changes in   µ  ´ or s´.

Define ?i for i=1..N as the descending ordered eigenvalues of     ?    (L) and     v    i as their
corresponding eigenvectors.  If no additional information is available, it can be assumed
that the maximum eigenvalued eigenvector     v    1 approximates the GGoF trace’s tangent
direction.  The remaining eigenvectors specify the normal directions.  Expected variances
in each of the normal directions are specified by eigenvalue ratios; the expected variance in
the eigen-direction,     v    i | i=2..N, is (?´)2 = (s´)2?i/?2.

To help understand the N+1 dimensional GGoF “space” (  µ ´, s´) of an N dimensional
distribution, slices through the 3D GGoF space of a 2D distribution in (f0,f1) can be
calculated.  Consider the scattergram shown in Fig. 4.  Those 900 samples were generated
from a simulated GPGD, Class A.  Class A is defined by three approximating cubic B-
splines and four isotropic control Gaussians (Table 1).  Each spline governs one of the
three parameters of the Gaussians, i.e., f0, f1, ?.  To generate a sample, a parametric value t
is chosen from the uniform distribution U[0,1].  The three splines are evaluated at that t
value, an isotropic Gaussian distribution is thus defined, and from that distribution the
sample is then generated.  Figs. 5-7 are the GGoF values for fixed s´ and a range of  µ ´ values
using the samples in Fig. 4.  1D GGoF traces appear along the extent of the distribution.

3 . 3 Gaussian Goodness-of-Fit Trace Extraction

As mentioned previously, GGoF traces are based on medialness cores.  Techniques
developed for medialness core extraction are used to extract GGoF traces.  The three steps
involved are trace stimulation, traversal, and traversal termination.

Trace Stimulation. A trace stimulation point has two components,  µ 0 and s0.  FGMM
is used to specify   µ  0.  Specifically, the user must select the number of FGMM components
to use, the data are then modeled using FGMM, and the component mean which is nearest
(measured via Euclidean distance) to two other component means is chosen as  µ 0.  As a
result,   µ  0 will generally be located within a dense region of a sampled GPGD.  If multiple
traces are requested, the remaining component means are used.  The number of FGMM
components used appears to be non-critical; for all CGMMs developed in this paper the
stimulating FGMM used 7 components.

Specifying s0 reduces to determining an initial neighborhood size for calculating     ?    (L)
at   µ  0.  By assuming that the trace tangent at   µ  0 is well approximated by the maximum
eigenvalued eigenvector of     ?    (L), s0 is the square root of the second largest eigenvalue.  For
this paper, the initial neighborhood size is set equal to the distance between   µ  0 and its



Printed in Proceedings of the Information Processing for Medical Imaging Conference, Ed.

closest neighboring FGMM mean.  For the data in Fig. 4,   µ  0=(163.66, 80.08) and
s0=17.94.

Trace Traversal. The trace normals are approximated by the non-tangent eigenvectors
of      ?     (L) and a unit vector which points strictly in s.  These directions define a hyperplane in
GGoF space through which the local trace segment passes.  When this normal plane i s
slightly shifted in the local trace tangent direction, a gradient ascent with respect to the
GGoF values within that plane leads to a new trace point.  For this paper, a step size of 0.1
feature space units is used to shift the normal plane, gradient ascent within that shifted
plane is performed using Brent’s line search method [13], and gradient ascent terminates
when the gradient’s projection onto the plane is less than 0.1% of its total magnitude.  The
point in the plane at which gradient ascent terminates is the new trace point.  The new
tangent direction is approximated by the eigenvector of local data’s covariance matrix that
has the maximum magnitude dot product with the previous trace point’s tangent
eigenvector.  If the sign of the dot product is negative, the new tangent vector is negated to
maintain the direction of traversal.  This process is repeated until a traversal termination
criterion is met.

Trace Traversal Termination and Recovery. Trace traversal terminates when a
“well fitting” Gaussian cannot be found.  Empirical evidence suggests that encountering a
GGoF value of -10 or less is a reasonable stopping criterion.  This criterion was used to
terminate the traversal of every trace presented in this paper.

The rate of change of the trace is used to identify suspect trace points and halt their
inclusion into the trace without causing termination of the traversal process.  Such points
are “stepped over” using the tangents of the previous valid trace point.

The   µ  ´ component of a 1D GGoF trace of the data in Fig. 4 is shown in Fig. 8.  The
effect of recovery is visible as a break in the trace.  To visualize the normal variance
estimates provided by the trace, the 0, ±0.5, ±1, ±1.5, and ±2 ?´ points along the normal at
each trace point can be plotted (Fig. 9).  The next section details the conversion of a GGoF
trace to a CGMM.

3 . 4 CGMMs via GGoF Traces

As defined in Equation 4, two values, P(    x    |?) and P(?), are required at each trace point ? to
define a CGMM ?.  To calculate P(    x    |?), a trace point covariance matrix     ?    (?) must be
defined.  The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of      ?     (?) are defined by 1) the approximate normal
directions and expected variances which were used to calculate ?''s GGoF value (Section 3.2)



Printed in Proceedings of the Information Processing for Medical Imaging Conference, Ed.
James Duncan, Vermont, 1997.  14 Pages

and 2) the approximate tangent direction which is assigned a variance equal to the
maximum expected variance in a normal direction.

A trace point’s a priori probability P(?) is defined as the portion of samples it i s
expected to represent.  The expected number of samples that will be represented by a trace
point can be extrapolated based on the number of observed samples within a fixed standard
deviation, i.e., s, of that point.

The CGMM defined via the GGoF trace depicted in Figs. 8 and 9 produces the
probability density function depicted Fig. 10.  Although the GGoF trace extended beyond
the distribution, the low prior probabilities P(?) associated with those points reduce the
negative effects of the over extension.  The estimated density function should be compared
with the population’s actual density function which is shown in Fig. 11.  There appears to
be good correspondence.  The next section focuses on quantifying that correspondence.

4 CGMM’s Accuracy and Consistency

To determine the accuracy and consistency of a classifier and thereby determine the accuracy
and consistency of the distribution models it uses, Monte Carlo simulations and ROC
analyses must be performed.  This section begins by presenting an example classification
result.

4 . 1 Example Results

The accuracy and consistency of a modeling technique is being determined by the accuracy
and consistency of the labelings produced by classifiers that use the probability estimates
provided by those models.  Class A was defined in Section 3.2.  A competing class, Class
B, is defined as an isotropic Gaussian with   µ  =(128,128) and ?=36.  Given the set of 900
training samples from Class B, the stimulation point   µ  0=(160.37, 123.30) and s0=17.94 is
automatically chosen.  The resulting trace point conditional isoprobability curves overlaid
onto the training data scattergram are shown in Fig. 12.  Using the Class A and Class B
models developed thus far, every point in feature space can be assigned a label and an image
can be developed which reflects those labelings with differing shades of gray.  Fig. 13 i s
such an image with the optimal decision bounds between the classes overlaid in black.

The CGMMs of Classes A and B provide accurate labelings for the majority of feature
space.  To improve the CGMM’s labelings, multiple traces can be used.  While generally
containing redundant information, additional traces do refine a CGMM.  CGMMs using 7
traces per class (CGMM07) produce the labelings shown in Fig. 14.  FGMMs using 7
components per class (FGMM07) produce the labelings shown in Fig. 15.  Allocation to

Different shades of gray correspond to allocation to different traces/components.

Light gray shades indicate assignment to Class A

each trace/component is indicated by different shades of gray; light grays indicate

component is reduced to representing a sliver through feature space.  That component i s
being poorly utilized, and its use does not correspond with the underlying distribution.

Given 2700 testing samples from each class, the Class A TPRs and FPRs in Table 2 ,
Run1 are produced.  Compared to FGMM07, CGMM07 offers an 718% decrease in the FPR
with a less than 11% decrease in the TPR!  To determine if these results were anomalous,
new models were developed and tested using different samples from Classes A and B.  Those
results are summarized in Table 2, Run2.  CGMM07 again produced the lowest FPR, but the
differences are less dramatic.

While no conclusions should be drawn from these two runs, the results are quite
encouraging.  Not only does CGMM07 provide the lowest FPR values and competitive TPR

values, but there is also an ordered progression in the TPR & FPR values for CGMM as the
number of traces used is increased.  For FGMM, the use of additional components does not
always increase performance.

4 . 2 Monte Carlo Results

To gain an understanding of the expected consistency with which CGMMs model GPGDs,
Monte Carlo simulations involving Class A and Class B were performed.  Initial
simulations revealed that even after 5000 repetitions of the modeling and testing task of
Section 4.1, classifiers using FGMMs demonstrated extremely poor consistency.  So as to
compare CGMMs with FGMMs on a problem for which FGMMs provide consistent
performance, the Monte Carlo experiments reported in this paper limited their analysis to
the FGMMs and CGMMs of the GPGD, Class A.  Each classifier was provided with an exact
model of Class B.  Given 100 Monte Carlo runs involving 900 Class A training samples

Both modeling techniques demonstrate an ordered progression in consistency based on
their hyperparameter, i.e., number of components or number of traces.  FGMM’s
consistency, however, monotonically declines as additional components are used.
CGMM’s consistency monotonically improves as additional traces are used.  CGMM07 i s
shown to offer very competitive consistency.  ROC analysis is needed to compare the
accuracy of these classifiers.

4 . 3 ROC Analysis

By changing the a priori probability (ROC observer bias) associated with Class B while
keeping each class model and the testing data fixed, a continuum of FPR & TPR values are
defined.  These values form the ROC curves shown in Fig. 17.

Fig. 17. ROC curves from fixed data, FGMMs and CGMMs

Using these curves, three measures can be made to quantitatively compare the
classifiers’ accuracy: the area under each curve; the maximum probability of generating a
correct answer for each curve, i.e., Max-P(C) = MAX(TPR+(1-FPR)); and the TPR values of
each curve at fixed FPR values [8] .  Table 5 summarizes these measures.

FGMM07 0.8793 1.6159 0.6047 0.7155 0.7935

Table 4. Results of measures made on ROC curves in Fig. 19

The area under the CGMM07 curve is comparable to that of FGMM04 and only slightly
less than FGMM07.  CGMM07 provides performance similar to FGMM02, but well below
FGMM04 and FGMM07.  As demonstrated in both experiments of Section 4.1, CGMM07
provides the best TPR value for the smallest FPR tested, i.e., FPR=0.1.  This ROC analysis,
however, is based on a single instance of a model and does not reveal expected accuracy.

To determine the expected accuracy of CGMMs and FGMMs on the Class A / Class B
problem, the Monte Carlo averaged TPR & FPR values reported in Section 4.2 are used.
Specifically, the ROC curves passing through each classifier’s Monte Carlo averaged TPR
& FPR values can be explicitly calculated under the assumption that the class distributions
are unit variance Gaussians.  While that assumption is strictly incorrect for Class A, a
Gaussian is a first order approximation to Class A’s actual distribution.  The significant

measure produced from this ROC analysis is the probit measure d´, the spread of the means
[6].  More accurate models have larger d´ values.  Table 5 lists the relevant d´ values.

CGMM141 1 . 8 1 0 FGMM07 1.704

Table 5. Probit's d' value for ROC curves based on Monte Carlo averages (Table 3)

These values indicate that as additional cores are used, CGMMs can be expected to
asymptotically outperform the best performing FGMM when representing Class A, a
GPGD.  That is, under first order assumptions for Classes A and B, the area under the
CGMM14’s ROC curve will be larger, the maximum probability of being correct for
CGMM14 will be higher, and CGMM14 will provide a better TPR for every FPR value
compared to the best performing FGMM, i.e., FGMM02.
 Every one of the experiments performed suggests that for low FPRs, CGMMs composed
of a sufficient number of GGoF traces can be expected to provide better TPRs than any
FGMM via MLEM.   The next sections presents some "real-world" results, the
segmentation of an inhomogeneous medical image.

5 Inhomogeneous Magnetic Resonance Images

This section demonstrates the efficacy of CGMMs using GGoF traces for medical image
data.  Using the hand-labeled samples shown in Fig. 3, four GGoF traces can be
automatically extracted to represent each class.   Using these CGMMs, all of the points in
the image can be labeled as either gray or white matter.  While there will be errors since
other tissues are present, the results are very promising; the gray matter mask formed i s
given in Fig. 18.   The qualitative best FGMM was achieved using four components.
FGMM04’s gray matter mask is shown in Fig. 19.

Fig. 18. CGMM04’s gray matter mask Fig. 19. FGMM04’s gray matter mask

The differences between the CGMM and the FGMM masks are extremely small.   The
lack of a gold standard for this data prevents a quantitative comparison.  These results are
significant, however, in that they indicate that 1) CGMMs are a viable alternative for
GPGDs given “real-world” data and 2) CGMMs do not require the user to specify a
hyperparameter value, i.e., the number of components.

6 Conclusion

A CGMM of a GPGD can be defined using GGoF traces.  When such models are used for
classification, accurate labelings are produced.  Initial experiments indicate that for small
FPRs, this approach provides superior TPRs compared to FGMMs defined via MLEM.
Given different collections of training data, the TPRs and FPRs associated with these
labelings remain consistent relative to the consistency of the labelings produced by
FGMMs.  Furthermore, as additional GGoF traces are extracted, the accuracy and
consistency of the CGMM improves asymptotically; defining CGMMs using GGoF traces
avoids reliance on the user to specify critical hyperparameters such as the number of
components, and it avoids the problems associated with local maxima in iterative
parameter refinement processes, e.g., MLEM.  The application of CGMMs using GGoF
traces to medical image data and the existence of GPGDs in medical images is demonstrated
via the classification of tissues in an inhomogeneous MR image.  Current work is focusing
on the extraction of higher dimensional (M>1) GGoF traces and the development of
deformable distribution models using GGoF traces which adapt generic representations to
form more optimal specific representations.
